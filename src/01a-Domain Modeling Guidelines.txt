## Domain modelling guidelines

* Start with the workflows
* What data is needed?
  * From the event itself
  * From the current state of the system
  * What is optional vs. required?
* What are the output events?
  * For broadcast to downsteam systems
* What is the change in system state?
  * Is this a state transition?
* What are the side effects?
  * Things that must be done but are internal to the domain
* What can go wrong?
  * Model success or failure with an OR choice

* If you hear "it depends", drill deeper
* Disagreement between experts is OK. The design process is about
  getting *everyone* on the same page.
* Everyone must be in the room. Otherwise they miss being part of the process.
  It's not just about the results of the process

Example
====================

Workflow name: "Place order"
Data from Command/Event:
    OrderForm
Other Input Data:
    ProductCatalog (to look up prices)
Output events:
    (only if there is a different bounded context that cares what happened)
    OrderPlaced event
Output Data:
    (ValidatedOrder to store in db
     AND OrderAcknowledgment to send to the customer)
    OR OrderValidationError (if input is not valid)

data OrderForm =
  CustomerInfo
  AND ShippingAddress
  AND BillingAddress
  AND list of OrderLines

data OrderLine =
  ProductId
  AND OrderQuantity
  AND Price

data OrderValidationError =
  QuantityTooHigh (with ProductId)
  OR ProductNotFound (with ProductId)

data OrderQuantity =
  UnitQuantity
  OR KilogramQuantity

data UnitQuantity = integer between 1 and ?
data KilogramQuantity = decimal between ? and ?

data CustomerInfo = CustomerName AND ContactInfo
data BillingAddress = ??? // don't know yet

data CustomerName = FirstName AND LastName

data ContactInfo =
  EmailAddress
  OR PhoneNumber
