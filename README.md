# Workshop: Domain Modeling Made Functional (2 hour)

Functional programming and domain-driven design might not seem to be a good match,
but in fact functional programming can be an excellent approach to designing decoupled,
reusable systems with a rich domain model. This workshop will show you why.

This will be a short hands-on workshop designed for beginners in functional programming.


## Who is this for?

This will be especially useful for people learning functional programming -- all concepts used in the workshop will be explained. Previous development experience is recommended.

## What you'll learn

* How to represent the nouns and verbs of a domain using types and functions
* How to decouple the pure domain logic from the outside world
* How to ensure that constraints and business rules are captured in the design
* How to represent state transitions in the domain model


## Prerequisites

We will be using F# as our development language. No experience with F# needed.
Please install the F# compiler and an F#-friendly editor using these instructions:

* Install F#
  * [Instructions for Visual Studio and VS Code](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/get-started/install-fsharp)
  * [Instructions for JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/rider/F_Sharp.html)
* Clone the workshop repo locally. For example, by using
```
mkdir DmmfWorkshop2 
git clone https://github.com/swlaschin/DmmfWorkshop2 
```
* Open the project:
  * In VisualStudio/Rider, open `DmmfWorkshop2.sln`
  * In VS Code, open /src folder
* Open `00-HelloWorld.fsx` and follow instructions to check that F# is working


## Directory Structure

These folders contain the training material

* `/src/` contains the code
